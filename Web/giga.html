        Giganotosaurs will 'casually' stroll about the Island, slaughtering anything in their path. This can lead them to wander just about anywhere on the Island. Their lack of natural predators - or any form of threat to them - allows for their safe voyages across the Island. With no natural predator, the Giganotosaurus is considered the apex predator of the Island with its strength and size. One could argue that it is the driver of evolution on the maps they can be found on. Those that are strong enough to take one down or tame one are guaranteed to thrive nearly unchallenged. Those that canâ€™t manage it end up with significant resources lost at best, and ripped to shreds while possibly even losing everything at worst.
        The Giganotosaurus is an aggressive creature. Due to its rage mechanic, it will become enraged when being attacked, which makes its attacks deal more damage. It also regains stamina faster when enraged. If it builds up too much rage, it may even eat its own rider, right off the saddle!
        Its rage mechanic is not a health-percentage-based trigger; it only occurs if enough damage occurs quickly enough. It will also trigger even if the server is set to the friendliest possible PvE and no friendly-fire settings, in which normally it is not possible to hurt anything not wild.
        Due to its large stride, allowing it to walk over most obstacles, and naturally high movement speed, the Giganotosaurus can outrun just about anything on the island. Combined with its very large aggro range, this means it is a fast and dangerous predator.
        On Mobile, just like Tyrannosaurus, they will completely ignore mounted animals and don't wander. If there's no prey in the vicinity, they will stand in one place forever.
