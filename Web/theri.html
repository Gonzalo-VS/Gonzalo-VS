        I'm not entirely sure how Therizinosaurus multiensis stays populated on the Island. It is surprisingly slow for its size, and is a solitary predator (so no pack to back it up). I suppose the fact that its sheer power rivals Tyrannosaurus is the only thing that allows this very aggressive medium-sized predator to thrive. The claws of Therizinosaurus are some of the most versatile biological tools I've encountered, as adept at removing trees and foliage from Therizinosaurus' path as they are at piercing the thick shells and hide of the Island's most defensive creatures if backed into a fight.
